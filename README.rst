pyStrich
========

pyStrich is a Python module to generate 1D and 2D barcodes. Currently it
supports

-  code128
-  ean13
-  datamatrix
-  qrcode

|Build Status|

Usage
-----

The interface of the different encoders is fairly straightforward:

.. code:: python

    from pystrich.datamatrix import DataMatrixEncoder
    encoder = DataMatrixEncoder("This is a DataMatrix.")
    encoder.save( "sample_barcodes/datamatrix_test.png" )
    print(encoder.get_ascii())

.. figure:: sample_barcodes/datamatrix_test.png
   :alt: Sample of DataMatrix generated by the code above.

   Sample of DataMatrix generated by the code above.
Relevant imports are:

.. code:: python

    from pystrich.code128 import Code128Encoder
    from pystrich.datamatrix import DataMatrixEncoder
    from pystrich.ean13 import EAN13Encoder
    from pystrich.qrcode import QRCodeEncoder

Background
----------

pyStrich is a fork of huBarcode module with modifications to support
Python 3 (amongst other changes). pyStrich only supports encoding not
decoding.

`huBarcode <https://github.com/hudora/huBarcode>`__ was developed by
`HuDoRa <http://www.hudora.de/en/>`__ from at least 2007, the project
does not seem to have been active since late 2013. `Method B
Ltd <http://method-b.uk>`__ has forked it to provide Python 3 support
and facilitate future development. Thank you to the folks at HuDoRa for
doing most of the hard work, porting was the easy part.
